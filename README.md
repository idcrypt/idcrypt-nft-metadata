# idcrypt-nft-metadata

This repository hosts the open, transparent, and decentralized metadata used to mint and represent article-based NFTs from the [idcrypt.xyz](https://www.idcrypt.xyz) publication.

Each article minted as an NFT on the Solana blockchainâ€”using the ARDION tokenâ€”refers to one metadata file hosted in this repository. This ensures full auditability and independence of content indexing, accessible to the public.
